## About The Project

Data Persistence and Access is another assingment and course project in the Advanced .NET program by Noroff. Here we focus on manipulating data from an SQL database.

There are two parts to the assignment.
Appendix A focuses on different SQL Queries, whereas Appendix B focuses on Database manipulation, adding, getting etc in C# together with SQL Queries. 

Appendix A is present in the "SQLScripts" folder, the rest is Appendix B.
